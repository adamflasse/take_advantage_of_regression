<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

In our learning path at Becode we had multiple group project focusing on real estate in Belgium. First we had to scrape some websites to find data and make a solid dataset out of it. Then we had to "merge" all the other groups dataset and work on it. We've essentially done some major data cleaning on it and then use what we've learned about data visualization and make a presentation out of it. We had a week to to get familiar with all types of regression and after we were asked to test our knowledge to predict the best we can the price of houses on the Belgian market with the dataset of our previous mission.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Because of the groups changing between the different missions we had different dataset available in order to complete the mission. So we choose the most appropriate one to start the project in the most efficient way possible.

### Choosing the dataset

The most appropriate dataset had to have less texts, blanks and NANs possible and a structured data. So we agreed to choose the dataset of Orhan's previous group.


### Evaluate what we have to do

First thing first we have to choose the important features in order to make a proper cleaning and not waste our time on columns that we won't use.
Secondly we have to transform every text in each feature's column into numbers in order to make the model work.
